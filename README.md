## Merge Conflict Resolution Steps
1. A merge conflict occurred when merging `feature-branch` into `main`.
2. The conflict was in `file.txt`.
3. The conflict was resolved by manually editing the file to include changes from both branches.
4. The resolved file was staged and committed to complete the merge.
